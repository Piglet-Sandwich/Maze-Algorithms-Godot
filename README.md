# Maze-Algorithms-Godot
Maze generating algorithms for possible implementation into godot

-probablydisfuctional.gd is the inspiration for this repository as I made it 2 years ago for a game I never finished. It is just a simple depth first search backtracking algorithm with a gap of sorts in the middle for a "spawn". The code, some of the first I wrote, is pretty bad. Also the tilemap used must have the same layout as tilemaplayout
-DFSBMA (Depth first search backtracking maze generating algorithm) is what the name is and is for python and works all by itself.
